## Introduction

Table top session manager - Demo of functionalities for small web app designed to create notes and describe NPCs for table top RPG sessions.

## How to run locally?

This app requires communication with REST API, that is not yet deployed publicly. To get full functionallity for session manager, following steps must be completed:

1. Download zip file of this project or fork it. Open it in your IDE and run `npm install` in the terminal.
   To run this project without API, type `npm run dev` in the terminal. Hosted application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` address in your browser.

2. Next step is to setup either JSON server, or use existing demo for REST API dedicated for this project. You can find it here => [TT Session Manager's Backend](https://github.com/JBryskiewicz/dms-backend). Instruction on how to set it up locally is included in backend's README file.

3. Once you have both frontend and backend apps running, you can now use this app locally in form of functionality demo.

## Final goal

Currently this project is being improved constantly. Once all the functionalities are implemented and all bugs are fixed, it will be deployed publicly. This way demo will be more accessable to everyone who wants to try using it.
